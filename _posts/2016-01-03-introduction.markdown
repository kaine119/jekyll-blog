Hello, I'm Kai En.

I'm a 14-year-old Secondary student, participating in [Google Code-In 2015][gci]. I play the drum kit.

Over the course of GCI, I've worked with [FOSSASIA][fossasia], a non-profit organisation dedicated to supporting developers of Free and Open Source technologies.

With them, I have learnt many things about open source development, including how to collaborate with others on [Github][github].

The FOSSASIA community is very helpful and friendly.
